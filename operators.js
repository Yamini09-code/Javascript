//expressions and operators 
//a fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression, every value written literally is an expression eg "harry" and 7
//77;
//"mini"
//false

//operators in js
let a = 45
let b =4
console.log("a/b is", a/b)//in js / gives the whole value including decimal place not only the quotient value 
console.log("a%b is", a%b)
console.log("a**b is", a**b)
console.log("a++", a++)
console.log("a--", a--)

//assignment operator
let p = 4
let q = 9
console.log(p+=q)// p = p+q

//comparison operator
let c = 6
let d = "6"
console.log(c==d)//compares value
console.log(c===d)//compares value and type both
console.log(c!==d)//compares value and type both
console.log(c!=d)//compares value

//logical operator --> &&, ||, !
